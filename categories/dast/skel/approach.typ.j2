With a dynamic web
((*- if target.data.api *)) service (@api)
((*- else *)) application
((*- endif *))
test, an attack by a malicious attacker is simulated.
In this case the target
((*- if target.data.authentication *)) supports authentication
    ((*- if target.data.credentials_provided *)) and the credentials were provided.
    ((*- else *)) but the credentials were not provided.
    ((*- endif *))
((*- else *)) does not support authentication.
((*- endif *))

The penetration test of the ((( target.data.name ))) was performed using a combination of manual and automated testing techniques, including but not limited to:

- Information gathering and reconnaissance to identify potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities in the target.
- Automated vulnerability scanning to identify common vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in the target.
- Manual testing to identify complex vulnerabilities that may not be detected by automated tools, such as business logic flaws, authentication bypass, and access control issues.
- Exploitation of identified vulnerabilities to assess their impact and the potential for an attacker to compromise the target.
- Post-exploitation activities to assess the extent of the compromise and the potential for lateral movement within the target environment.

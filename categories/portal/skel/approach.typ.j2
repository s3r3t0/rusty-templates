((= Approach =))

With a @PORTAL:long:cap approach, the penetration test was performed using a combination of manual and automated testing techniques, including but not limited to:

- Information gathering and reconnaissance to identify potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities in the cloud environment.
- Automated vulnerability scanning to identify common vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in the cloud environment.
- Manual testing to identify complex vulnerabilities that may not be detected by automated tools, such as logical flaws, authentication bypass, and access control issues.
- Exploitation of identified vulnerabilities to assess their impact and the potential for an attacker to compromise the cloud environment.
- Post-exploitation activities to assess the extent of the compromise and the potential for lateral movement within the cloud environment, including the potential for data exfiltration and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
